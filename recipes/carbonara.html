    <h2> Pasta dish that takes you to the romantic hills of Tuscany</h2>
    <h3> Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 100g pancetta</li>
            <li> 50g pecorino</li>
            <li> 50g parmesan</li>
            <li> 3 eggs</li>
            <li> 350g spaghetti</li>
            <li> 50g butter</li>
            <li> sea salt</li>
            <li> 2 garlic cloves</li>
        </ul>
    <h3> step-by-step preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.</li>
            <li>Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind.
                Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.</li>
            <li>Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black pepper. 
                Set everything aside.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil, 
                cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).</li>            
            <li>Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.</li>
            <li>While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic.
                 Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted,
                 tip in the pancetta and garlic.</li>
            <li>Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp.
                The garlic has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.</li>
            <li>Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta.
                Don't worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don’t throw the pasta water away yet.</li>
            <li>Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.</li>
            <li>Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese.
                Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, 
                which thickens but doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated.</li>
            <li>Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it). 
                You don’t want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed.</li>
        </ol>
